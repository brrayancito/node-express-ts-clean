# Express TypeScript API with MongoDB and JWT Authentication

This repository contains a simple and secure API built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript. implementing the Clean Architecture repository pattern. The design ensures a clear separation of concerns, promoting maintainability and scalability.

The API uses MongoDB for data persistence, providing a flexible and performance-oriented NoSQL solution. The repository pattern implemented allows for easy swapping of the database layer if needed in the future.


## Key Features:


- Node.js & Express: Our API is built on the powerful Node.js runtime environment, using Express to handle routing and server setup.
- Clean Architecture Repository Pattern: The API is designed following the Clean Architecture principles, ensuring a clear separation of concerns between business logic and technology.
- MongoDB: For data storage, we use MongoDB, a NoSQL database offering flexibility, scalability, and performance.
- JWT Authentication: Our API uses JWT for user authentication. This ensures that certain routes are protected and only accessible to logged-in users.
